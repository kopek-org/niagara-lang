val shape_encoding : shape Json_encoding.encoding

(** Representation of a group population. Each domain to a set of cases, the
    corresponding space point being the cartesian product of each case set.

    This representation might in some cases need to be fragmented, hence the list.

    An example:
    - Domain A: cases A1, A2
      Domain B: case B1
    - Domain A: case A2
      Domain B: case B2

    There is two fragments: the first represent the points (A1, B1) and (A2,
    B1), and the second (A2, B2). It would not be possible to include the latter
    in the former because
    - Domain A: cases A1, A2
      Domain B: cases B1, B2
    represents the points (A1, B1), (A1, B2), (A2, B1) and (A2, B2), which is
    one too many.

    Some invariants of a well-formed description:
    - Every fragment are disjoints
    - Every domain exists in every fragment and contains at least on case.

    domain. This is akin to a wildcard.
